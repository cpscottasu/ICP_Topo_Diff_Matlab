# ICP_Topo_Diff_Matlab
Matlab code and earthquake topography datasets to experiment with ICP 3D differencing

Contents: 
1. Lecture slides about ICP 3D differencing
2. Matlab code that performs windowed ICP and plots the results. There are several Matlab files listed in the included Matlab script that must be downloaded from MathWorks. 
3. Pre and post 2016 M7 Kumamoto, Japan, Earthquake las datasets. These are read by the Matlab code 


The Kumamoto datasets can be downloaded from OpenTopography: 

Pre-earthquak:

Post-earthquake:
